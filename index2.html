      <h3><strong>Benefits of using GitHub</strong></h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      One big benefit to using Git is that you can collaborate on projects through one channel (repository) with which whenever changes are made to the project, Git will keep track of all changes made so no work is lost. People in different areas would also be able to work on the same project through cloning and creating their own local repositories in which the changes can be committed to the central repository and saved in its history so everyone can still see them.
      Another benefit is the pull requests feature on Git which acts as a commenting feature just like on a text editor where you can comment your code without messing up the code. Pull requests is another way of allowing other designers that are working on the same project through different repositories to help on any difficulties you might be having in your code through means of merging one of your branches into their repository.
      Git is very beneficial especially for UX designers where prototyping Is a big part of their job. The ability to create different branches creates individual areas In which the designer can create different prototypes of the final product, almost like wireframing a website. These protypes will work just like the real product making it beneficial for prototyping as the designer can see how different changes/approaches affect it whilst avoiding the breakage of the actual code (for the final product). Presenting these prototypes to someone is as easy as telling them the branch names they were done under and it can be checked out.
      In summary, Git is just a very useful platform to conduct group websites as information can be saved and shared easily and efficiently saving designers valuable time worrying about eerors in code or working on one website using multiple devices in different places, etc and can devote all their much needed time on making the website.
